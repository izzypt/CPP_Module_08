# STL Containers

A Standard Template Library (STL) container in C++ is a template class or type that provides a way to store and organize elements of the same or different types. 

These containers implement various data structures and algorithms for common tasks, offering a high level of abstraction and providing a consistent interface. 

STL containers play a crucial role in C++ programming by offering efficient and reusable solutions for managing collections of data.

Containers abstract away the underlying data structure and implementation details, allowing programmers to focus on algorithms and logic without worrying about low-level details.
